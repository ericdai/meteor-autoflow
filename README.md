# AutoFlow
AutoFlow is a Meteor package that enables declarative creation of multi-page forms using JSON.  This package requires and automatically installs the [AutoForm](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform), [JSONSchema](https://github.com/fullflavedave/meteor-json-schema), and [simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) packages. You can optionally use it with the [collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) package, which you have to add to your app yourself.

## Disclaimer
This package is not expected to be usable until October 2015.  It undoubtedly contains many serious bugs.
