# AutoFlow #
AutoFlow is a Meteor package that enables declarative creation of multi-page forms using JSON.  This package requires and automatically installs the [AutoForm](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) and [simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) packages. You can optionally use it with the [collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) package, which you have to add to your app yourself.

## Under Development
Disclaimer:  This package is not expected to be usable until October 2015.  It is currently under heavy development and undoubtedly contains many bugs.
